How to build: 
	g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 

How to run (if it compiles successfully)
	./a.out


*************************************************

Directions: 
	Write a program that will give 20 addition questions or 
subtraction questions.  The user will provide the their answer, 
and this answer will be checked on weather if its correct or not.  
The number of correct answers will then be used to give the user 
both a % grade and a Letter Grade. 

Important notes:
- Numbers should be limited from 0 -> 9
- Subtraction problems should always subtract larger from the smaller.
- Please provide basic comments on any if / else statements stating 
	what their purpose is.   If an if statement is used to check
	weather we are performing addition or subtraction, simply 
	just notate addition check.  The following else bracket should
	then be noted that this block is for the subtraction.
	
	/// Addition
	if(i % 2 == 0)
	{ ... }
	/// subtraction
	else
	{ ... }

- Try to limit repeating code in various if / else blocks.   Try to find 
	ways to run the same line of code only once.  
- Try to think about how to organize if / else statements to limit how much
	typing you have to do, and how many computations the computer must 
	do.
